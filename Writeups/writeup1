How many slurm job will be submitted?
There are three "job array" that are submitted in the sbatch file, 0, 1, and 2 (so three total).

What is the purpose of the if statement?
If statement: i % SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_COUNT == SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID
In the if statement, they are looking at the remainder of the index i divided by the SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_COUNT and checking if it is equal to the SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID. Since there are 3 total job array tasks, this is the remainder of i divided by 3. If its true, it then prints the index i followed by some text like "I: [random text].

What is the expected output in each *.out file?
Like it says in the Sbatch file comments, the above if statement allows you to loop through the data.txt file, which is just:

12
7
91
8
27
30

Therefore, I think the output should be each of the indexes followed by followed by each line of the text. I'm not sure if the index used is the index from data.txt or another index, so the numbers below might not be accurate, for example:

1: 12
2: 7
3: 91
4: 8
5: 27
6: 30
